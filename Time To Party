Itâ€™s time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party


Without you I am no one no body
About you I am crazy oh hottie
Give it to me baby cure my heartache 

It's time to party
It's time to party 

no harm to animals vegan our leather
no show of skin vegan our leather
when do we gather We go together
climbing the ladder higher the better

It's time to party
It's time to party

Time froze when you said hi
How did you do it, why?
Deep in you eyes baby
I felt like crucified

Lord of the drinks came by
Beauty lies in the
Eyes of tequila guys 

Faces turn blue and white
So wrong but mostly right
Give me some sugar baby
I'll be all yours all night 

To saw raw power we can just dance off
Put on the music put up the trance on
Never again we're leaving the dance floor 

It's time to party
It's time to party 

Tear up my fate and free us this moment
World ends tonight don't torment us woman
Your taking shots so this is I'm hoping 

It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party 

I know it from the start
You're going to break my heart
Everyone's into you baby
Like a painting you're some art 

World seems so torn apart
One glimpse of you is what
Brings back earth to its axis
Baby you can do that

We get together we get so inky
We were so nice now we are so kinky
Driving is fun only after drinking 

It's time to party
It's time to party 


This is an old tale about your cold kill
When you're hunting no one can know where
We she the shadows and then you're there 

It's time to party
It's time to party 

You be the king and we will be the kong
We do it right and we do it all Wrong 
Someone will notice put us in a Song


It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party 

Wave your hands to the right
To creatures of night
Each time you do it baby
We forget what is right 

Started off on wrong foot
All our moves were good
In their moment of weakness
They were willing to try 

I would have saved myself from the trauma
I like your play and I like your drama
We will play someday our debts of karma 

It's time to party
It's time to party 

So high we're mighty as if we're titans
Flooding the faces with joy of night life 
Half of the nation is on probation 

It's time to party
Its time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party



They say you're so uptight
Show me now make some noise
You take your time to it
End of this road is bright 

Don't look at us surprised
We want a pice of yikes
We come from town that is young and is up all night 

Of multitudes of things that we are down to
We find a corner and we're pumped now
And we can promise We're gonna hurt you 

It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party

Here there everywhere that I know
Revving the cars or raving it out now
Moving our body until were out now 

It's time to party

Our battles are edgy when we're buzzed
We take your side cause in you we all trust
We all really mainly win because

It's time to party

It's time to party

*Time to party* End
